# Codeforces Problem Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions to Codeforces problems! This repository serves as a collection of my solutions, coding practices, and a log of my progress while solving competitive programming problems on Codeforces.

## About
This repository contains solutions to various Codeforces problems that I have solved. Each solution is implemented in a way to demonstrate clarity, efficiency, and adherence to competitive programming best practices.

```

- **`problems/All/`**: Contains all the problem solutions in one directory.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codeforces-solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the relevant problem file to view the solution.

3. Compile and run the solution (assuming `solution.cpp`):
   ```bash
   g++ solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution < input.txt > output.txt
   ```

## Highlights
- **Language**: Most solutions are implemented in C++ for optimal performance in competitive programming.
- **Efficiency**: Solutions are designed to minimize runtime and memory usage wherever possible.
- **Documentation**: Each solution is accompanied by inline comments explaining the approach and logic.
